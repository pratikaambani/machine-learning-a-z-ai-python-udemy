# Section 15: Part 3 - Classification

## 142. Welcome to Part 3 - Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM, and Random Forests.

### Machine Learning Classification Models:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

## 143. What is Classification in Machine Learning? Fundamentals and Applications

**Definition:** A Machine Learning technique to identify the category of new observations based on training data. Different than regression where we predict a number. Here we identify the category. It is a type of supervised machine learning.

### Use Cases:

- Medicine
- Marketing
- Businesses

### Examples:

- Which customers are likely to leave
- Email categorization
- Image recognition (e.g., dogs or cats)
